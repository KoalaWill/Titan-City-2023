# ＴＩＴＡＮ　ＣＩＴＹ, ３０２３
In this 2D sandbox RPG, players assume the role of an astronaut assigned to the critical mission of discovering a new habitable planet and constructing an outer-planet habitat. However, a mishap leads to the astronaut's consciousness being transferred into a robotic body. Throughout the adventure, players will encounter numerous challenges, including zero gravity, hazardous conditions, and more.
### Story
In the year 3023, Earth becomes uninhabitable for humans, prompting scientists to initiate a mission to relocate the population to a theoretically habitable planet in the outer solar system. However, during the voyage, a catastrophic spacecraft malfunction disrupts the pathfinder team. Fortunately, they land on a planet that, while not as ideal as Earth, is suitable for human survival. As one of the explorers, your mission is to establish a new home on this planet and ensure the safe transportation of others to their new refuge.
### Stage 1
Stage 1 serves as the entry level where you find yourself inside the spacecraft. Here, you have the opportunity to acquaint yourself with the game's controls. Your ultimate objective in this stage is to consume the space food, a delectable chocolate treat.
### Stage 2
Upon landing on the planet, your mission begins as you embark on the task of transforming it into a comfortable and welcoming home for all its future inhabitants.
